The nose unfurls dense black fruits (blackberry, cassis, black cherry) woven with violet, licorice, cocoa, cedar and tobacco, plus a graphite/mineral edge. Full-bodied and powerful on the palate; the core is packed with ripe black fruits and dark chocolate, framed by abundant, fine-grained tannins typical of Tannat. Acidity is medium-high, bringing lift to the richness; oak is present but well-integrated, adding spice and toast without dominating. Savory undertones of dried herbs and a cool menthol/eucalyptus note emerge with air. The finish is long, vigorous and drying, with fruit, cocoa and cedar echoing for 30+ seconds. Decant 2–3 hours if drinking now; built for medium to long-term aging.",

Typically 90% Tannat and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from 50–100+ year-old vines; grapes are fully destemmed and fermented by variety (often in cement), with controlled micro-oxygenation—a technique pioneered in Madiran—to tame Tannat's formidable tannins. Élevage is about 12 months in French oak (≈50% new) before blending and light filtration. Madiran's clay-limestone and clay-siliceous soils, along with long, dry autumns, contribute to the wine's power, structure, and capacity to age."
