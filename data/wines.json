Savory undertones of dried herbs and a cool menthol/eucalyptus note emerge with air. The finish is long, vigorous and drying, with fruit, cocoa and cedar echoing for 30+ seconds.

Élevage is about 12 months in French oak (≈50% new) before blending and light filtration. Madiran's clay-limestone and clay-siliceous soils, along with long, dry autumns, contribute to the wine's power, structure, and capacity to age."
